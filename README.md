# üêû Custom ML Debuggers

A collection of custom debugging utilities for machine learning projects to help identify and visualize common issues during model development.

## Tools

### üîç NaN Detector
Utility for detecting NaN values in pandas DataFrames.
- NaN value detection

### üìä Classifier Plots
Visualization utilities for classification model debugging.
- Confusion matrix plots
- Learning curve plots

---
## Quick Start

```python
from my_debuggers import nan_detector, create_clf_plots
```
## Detect NaN values
```python
nan_detector = nan_detector(df)
# detects NaN values in a DataFrame
# df is a pandas DataFrame
```

## Generate classification plots
```python
create_clf_plots(model, X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val, model_name='Model', y_pred=None)
# Creates confusion matrix and learning curve plots for classification models
```
---
## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**(Optional) Create a virtual environment**(eg. [`miniconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install))
